                        <p>Congratulations to our high school Surf team on a great showing at the first MIL surf contest of the season. It was held last Saturday at Fleming's in Napili. The weather was great, the surf was good, and the team did well. Three of our five boys made their finals with Noah Haas taking 4th in Boys #2, Ozzi Reyes taking 2nd in Boys #3, and Byron Ellis taking the WIN in Boys #5!</p>
